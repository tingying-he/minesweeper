## About the game
### Implemented functionalities
#### Basic minesweeper function
* The user can left click to open a cell. If there is a mine underneath, then the game over. If not, it shows how many mines are around. If there are no mines around, automatically open all adjacent cells with no neighboring mines.

    * There is a countdown timer, and if time is up, then the game is over. If the remaining time is less than 20s, the color of the text will change to red to warn the user.
* A label shows the number of flagged mines out of all mines.
